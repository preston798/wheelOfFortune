# Final Project
# Preston Hancock
# This will be a wheel of fortune game. The program will select a category that has a list attached to it with the correct word. The program will create a new list that shows only a couple of the characters and the rest blank. 
# The user will guess a constonant. If it is in the hidden list, they will appear on the actual list and money will be added to the user's account. The user can also buy a vowel. There will be another box where they can guess the entire word or phrase.
# The user will "spin" a wheel in the background to get money added to their account if they choose a letter correctly. 
# 
# The program will first initilize the GUI and select a a category from the dictionary. The dictionary will be stored in a .txt file.
